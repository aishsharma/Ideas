Ideas
=====

A website where people can post ideas for things they want to make or wish existed. They can be about anything!

##Front End:
Bootstrap, Font Awesome, Jquery and Sammy.js

##Back End:
Python, Bottle.py and SQL Alchemy

##Database:
SQLite

##Prerequisites
1. Python 3 must already be installed in the system.
2. If you are using an OS other than Windows, please edit the
batch/powershell script files accordingly.

##Installation
If you're ok with running the site on a Python virtual environment, just run
the "installer.bat" or "installer.sh1" script files. Both files do the same
thing so you only need to run one of them.

To start the site, go into the src folder and run any one of the "run" files.
You can now navigate to http://localhost:8080 in your browser to access the site.

If you don't want to run it in a virtual environment, simply edit the batch/powershell files
appropriately.
